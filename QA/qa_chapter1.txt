QA CHAPTER 1
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) Expansions and substitutions allow you to _____.


* make our program larger
* output information to the screen
* tell Bash to generate or calculate a value that may not be known before the script runs
        Correct: The code you write expands or is substituted into a value to be used in the script.
* replace the contents of another program with ours.



2) Which of these describes brace expansion?


* performs mathematical operations and returns the result
* generates a pattern or range of numbers or letters
        Correct: Brace expansion is used to create alphanumeric sequences, and to substitute values from a list in a script.
* returns part or all of a stored value
* runs a specified command and returns the result


3) you use command substitution to _____.

* run a command or command pipeline, and then return the output of that to Bash, as a string of text or as a variable
        Correct:Command substitution is used to get values from other programs into our program.

* to make sure you always run built-in versions of tools, rather than their command version
* to take over another program's operation
* to replace an existing command with our script instead


4) Which of these describes parameter expansion?


* runs a specified command and returns the result
* returns part or all of a stored value
        Correct: Retrieving a full or partial value from a parameter allows us to work with variables.
* performs mathematical operations and returns the result
* generates a pattern or range of numbers or letters

5) echo {1..20..2} is an example of _____.

* arithmetic expansion
* parameter expansion
* brace expansion
                Correct: This will result in the sequence "1 3 5 7 9 11 13 15 17 19".
* command substitution

6) To use the command version of echo instead of the builtin version, you would write _____.
* command echo
        Correct
* echo
* Bash echo
* builtin echo

7) A Bash builtin is _____.

* a command that's part of Bash, which you can rely on being present wherever Bash is running
        Correct: Bash builtins provide us a platform of standard commands you can be sure will be available.

* a computer that has Bash pre-installed, because it has Bash built in.
* an optional loadable module that provides additional functionality in Bash
* what you call a Bash script when it can be executed like a regular program

8) The symbols [ ] represent _____.

* braces
* quotes
* parentheses
* brackets
        Correct: While they're sometimes called 'square brackets', the name is kind of redundant. But, it still gets used.

9) Which of these are braces?

* ()
* $$
* []
* {}
        Correct: While they're sometimes called 'curly braces', the name is kind of redundant. But, it still gets used.

10) Bash stands for _____.
* Basic Analog Shell
* Bourne Again Shell
        Correct: Bash takes its name from the earlier Bourne Shell, which it extends.
* Behold! Another Shell!
* Boring, Available Shell

11) Bash is a(n) _____.
* terminal
* operating system
* shell
        Correct: Bash is a shell, and the commands it provides can be used either interactively at the command line, or composed into scripts, which can be run like regular programs.
* IDE

12) The redirection operation mycmd 2>myfile sends _____.

* information from the standard error (stderr) when running myfile to a command called mycmd

* reads information from myfile into the standard input (stdin) of the command mycmd
* information from the standard error (stderr) when running mycmd to a file called myfile
        Correct: When using redirection, '2' refers to standard error, and '1' refers to standard output.
* information from the standard output (stdout) when running mycmd to a file called myfile


13) A pipe sends the output of one command _____.

* as input to the next command
        Correct: Pipes are useful for building compound commands.
* to the standard error (stderr)
* to Bash
* to the standard output (stdout)

14) echo ${myvar:3:7} is an example of _____.

* parameter expansion
        Correct: This example will return characters from the string 'myvar', starting with the 3rd character and running for 7 after that.
* command substitution
* arithmetic expansion
* brace expansion

15) echo $(uname -r) is an example of _____.

* parameter expansion
* arithmetic expansion
* brace expansion
* command substitution
        Correct: This allows us to use output from the 'uname' command as a value in our script.


16) Which of these describes command substitution?

* generates a pattern or range of numbers or letters
* performs mathematical operations and returns the result
* returns part or all of a stored value
* runs a specified command and returns the result
        Correct: The result of an external command can then be used as a value in the script.

17) $(( $a + $b)) is an example of _____.

* brace expansion
* command substitution
* parameter expansion
* arithmetic expansion
        Correct: This will evaluate the expression and return the result.

18) Which of these describes arithmetic expansion?

* runs a specified command and returns the result
* generates a pattern or range of numbers or letters
* returns part or all of a stored value
* performs mathematical operations and returns the result
        Correct: Arithmetic expansion returns a calculated value.
